# Stepmania Theme With No Name Yet

This is a WIP stepmania theme that is focusing on DDR style pad play primarily.

## Work in progress

Feel free to ignore this repo until an eventual 1.0 relase
The issues are atm mostly for me to keep track of what I have left to do etc, I will clean them up if I ever do release a 1.0

## Special Thanks

Aaron C for his good documentation on various [DDR scoring systems](http://aaronin.jp/ddrssystem.html#ss10)
kyzentun for the [consensual theme](https://github.com/AratnitY/consensual/), which was a huge inspiration (I can make my own stuff without messing around with the insanely obtuse metrics.ini file? Sold!)
